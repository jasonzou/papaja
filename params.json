{"name":"papaja","tagline":"An R package to prepare APA journal articles using RMarkdown","body":"# papaja: Prepare APA Journal Articles\r\npapaja is a R-package in the making including a [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) template that can be used with (or without) [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) to produce complete manuscripts, which conform to the American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript guidelines (6th Edition). The package uses the LaTeX document class [apa6](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/apa6) and a .docx-reference file, so you can create beautiful PDF documents or Word documents if you have to. papaja also supplies R-functions that are meant to facilitate the reporting of statistics in accordance with APA guidelines.\r\n\r\n**Note, at this point papaja is in active development and should be considered alpha. If you experience any problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues) on Github.**\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nTake a look at the [.Rmd](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/example/example.Rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/example/example.pdf). The example document also contains some basic instructions.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n### Requirements\r\nTo use papaja you need to make sure the following software is installed on your computer:\r\n\r\n- [R](http://www.r-project.org/) (2.11.1 or later)\r\n- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) (0.98.932 or later) is optional; if you don't use RStudio, you need to install [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) using the [instructions for your operating system](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/master/PANDOC.md)\r\n- The `devtools` package (`install.packages(\"devtools\")`) to install papaja from Github\r\n- A [TeX](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) distribution (2013 or later; e.g., [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac, obviously, or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux)\r\n  - If you are running **Windows**, use MikTex if possible. Currently, pandoc and the Windows version of Tex Live [don't seem to like each other](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/6). Make sure you install the *complete*---not the basic---version.\r\n  - If you are running **Ubuntu 14.04** you need a couple of TeX packages in addition to the already installed ones for the document class `apa6` to work:\r\n\r\n```S\r\nsudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-bibtex-extra texlive-publishers texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra texlive-humanities\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Install papaja\r\nOnce all that is taken care of, install papaja from GitHub:\r\n\r\n```S\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"crsh/papaja\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Create a manuscript\r\nOnce papaja is installed, you can select the APA template when creating a new Markdown file through the menus in RStudio.\r\n\r\n![APA template selection](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1q6sb0ma0ligm9/template_selection.png?dl=1)\r\n\r\nIf you want to add citations specify your .bib-file in the YAML header of the document (`bibliography: my.bib`) and you can start citing. If necessary, have a look at RMarkdown's [overview of the citation syntax](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).\r\n\r\n### Helper functions to report analyses\r\nThe functions `apa_print()` and `apa_table()` facilitate reporting of results. Take a look at the [.Rmd](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/example/example.Rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/example/example.pdf).\r\n\r\nDrop a supported analysis result, such as an `htest`- or `lm`-object into `apa_print()` and receive a list of possible character strings that you can use to report the results of your analysis.\r\n\r\n```S\r\nmy_lm <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width + Petal.Length, data = iris)\r\napa_lm <- apa_print(my_lm)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne element of this list is `apa_lm$table` that, in the case of an `lm`-object, will contain a complete regression table. Pass `apa_lm$table` to `apa_table()` to turn it into a proper table in your PDF or Word document (remember to set the chunk option `results = \"asis\"`).\r\n\r\n```S\r\napa_table(apa_lm$table)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe sure to also check out `apa_barplot`.\r\n\r\n### Using papaja without RStudio\r\nYou don't use RStudio? No problem. Use the `rmarkdown::render` function to create articles:\r\n\r\n```S\r\nrmarkdown::render(\"mymanuscript.Rmd\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Papers that use papaja\r\nAlthough papaja is not yet on CRAN and is still undergoing a lot of changes, there are already peer-reviewed publications that use it. If you have published a paper that was written with papaja, let me know and I will add it to this list.\r\n\r\nStahl, C., Barth, M., & Haider, H. (2015). Distorted estimates of implicit and explicit learning in applications of the process-dissociation procedure to the SRT task. *Consciousness & Cognition*, 37, 27â€“43. doi:[10.1016/j.concog.2015.08.003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2015.08.003)\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n- The references violates the APA guidelines in that there is no hanging indentation (i.e. indentation of all lines but the first one). See the [related issue](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/issues/37) for a fix.\r\n- Citations may mess with RStudios syntax highlighting in the current line. Incorrect highlighting following a citation does not necessarily indicate incorrect syntax.\r\n- Printing PDF from RStudio's PDF viewer can produce weird results. If you want to print your manuscript I suggest you use any other PDF viewer of your choice.\r\n- When creating a word document on Windows, special characters in title, abstract, and note are not rendered correctly. This is a bug in [`r-yaml`](https://github.com/viking/r-yaml/issues/6) and has been for a while, but it will soon be addressed by a [workaround](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/420) in `knitr`.\r\n\r\n# Other journal templates\r\nObviously, not all journals require manuscripts and articles to be prepared according to APA guidelines. If you are looking for other journal article templates, the following list of `rmarkdown`/`pandoc` packages and templates may be helpful. If you know of other packages and templates, drop us a note, so we can add them here.\r\n\r\n- [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles): The rticles package includes a set of R Markdown templates that enable authoring of R related journal and conference submissions.\r\n- [Michael Sachs' pandoc journal templates](https://github.com/sachsmc/pandoc-journal-templates): Pandoc templates for the major statistics and biostatistics journals\r\n\r\nFinally, in case you prefer to work with Python, have a look at the [Academic Markdown](https://github.com/smathot/academicmarkdown)-module.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
